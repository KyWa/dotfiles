Created a new repo in Github called MineOps. It is what devopstraining was supposed to be. This will give a focus on Minecraft server and how to deploy it and all the various things you can do with a DevOps mindset. Will focus on Git, Ansible, Docker and of course minecraft. One of the issues for a stretch goal is to have CI/CD, but the problem is that there is no easy way to pull the latest minecraft server image. Minecraft.net puts everything with a SHA in the URL so there is no way to "guess" what that is. Its not a matter of blocking the URL, its just the sha of the jar they release. There is an option for PaperMC to pull automatically via an API, but needs more looking into.
