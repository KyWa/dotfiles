# RHCE

RHEL 8 Based With Ansible

The performance-based Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) exam (EX294) tests your knowledge and skill in managing multiple systems using Red Hat® Ansible® Engine and executing common system administration tasks across a number of systems with Ansible. The skills tested in this exam are the foundation for system administration across many Red Hat products.

By passing this exam, you become an RHCE, which also counts toward becoming a Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA).

This exam is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux® 8 and Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.7. 

Preparation

Red Hat encourages you to consider taking Red Hat System Administration I (RH124), Red Hat System Administration II (RH134), and Red Hat System Administration III: Linux Automation (RH294) to help prepare.  Attendance in these classes is not required; students can choose to take just the exam.

Exam format

This hands-on, practical exam requires you to use Red Hat Ansible Engine to perform real-world tasks. You will be provided with multiple systems and will be required to install and configure Ansible Engine and then use it to perform standard system administration tasks similar to what you would do on the job.  

You will be required to create Ansible Playbooks and use those playbooks to configure systems for specific roles and behaviors. Your work will be evaluated by applying the playbooks created during the exam against freshly installed systems and verifying that those systems and services work as specified.

During the exam, you will be provided a list of tasks to accomplish related to the exam objectives.  In most cases, the tasks will be described in terms of a specific end state that you must achieve. Your exam will be evaluated on whether your systems meet the criteria specified.

Internet access is not provided during the exam, and you will not be permitted to bring any hard copy or electronic documentation into the exam. This prohibition includes notes, books, or any other materials.  For most exams, the documentation that ships with the product is available during the exam.
