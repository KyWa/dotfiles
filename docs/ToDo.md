# ToDo

`xfs`: commit options better and learn how to use xfs_admin more
`systemctl`: get more acclimated to the use of listing all units on a system (chkconfig is gone idiot)
`acl`: A few issues, get more familiar with setting defaults and masks
`chmod`: special permissions and sticky bits. Also specifics for execute only on directories
`selinux`: get more familiar with the bools and contexts
