# Google Chat Tally Bot

The plan here is to create a bot that can keep a running tally for targets. Example below:


```
Person A: "Man, Bill sure is doing good"
Person B: "+1 Bill"
Bot: "Bill is now at +33"
Person A: "I wonder how Lee is doing?"
Person A: "@bot Lee"
Bot: "Lee is at -99"
Person B: "Lee is just keeps getting lower"
```
