## Duplicate Key Issue and Resolution
Originally noticed where an Organization in Quay would throw a 500 error when trying to do anything or even trying to `podman login` to that org.

Most of this information is from https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-troubleshooting-fixing-duplicate-primary-key-rows

### Attempt to REINDEX the table
```
quay-database=# REINDEX TABLE logentry3;
ERROR:  could not create unique index "pk_logentry3"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(18656660) is duplicated.
CONTEXT:  parallel worker
```

### Find and Count Duplicates
`SELECT count(*) FROM logentry3 a JOIN(SELECT id, count(*) FROM logentry3 GROUP BY id HAVING count(*) > 1) AS b ON b.id = a.id;`

### Print Duplicate Entries
`SELECT b.id from logentry3 a join (select id, max(datetime) AS last_datetime from logentry3 group by id having (count(*) > 1)) b on a.id = b.id and a.datetime < b.last_datetime;`

### Preparation to Delete Duplicates
```
# Create table backup as a precaution
CREATE TABLE backup_logentry3 AS SELECT * FROM logentry3;

# Create table to store the deleted duplicates for debugging if need be
CREATE TABLE breakfix_logentry3_dupes (LIKE breakfix_logentry3);
```

### Delete Duplicates
```
# These first two basically turn off "helpers" that would get in the way due to duplicate keys
SET enable_indexscan = off;
SET enable_bitmapscan = off;

WITH goodrows AS (
  SELECT min(ctid) FROM breakfix_logentry3 GROUP BY id
)
,mydelete AS (
  DELETE FROM breakfix_logentry3 WHERE not exists (SELECT 1 FROM goodrows WHERE min=ctid) RETURNING *
)
INSERT INTO breakfix_logentry3_dupes SELECT * FROM mydelete;
```

## Misc Commands
### Query to get Columns for a Table
`SELECT table_schema, table_name, column_name, data_type FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE table_name = 'SOME_TABLE';`

### Query to get Indicies for a Table
`SELECT indexname, indexdef FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'logentry3';`

### Issue with Quay Database and bogus data for an image
