# DevSpaces

## GitHub CoPilot
With GitHub CoPilot being a unique Microsoft owned extension, you cannot install it in DevSpaces when using the `open-vsx.org` plugin registry and need to download it manually and install with `code --install-extension /path/to/file.vsix`. To download the `vsix` files for GitHub CoPilot and CoPilot Chat, you currently have to essentially copy a link and replace a value with the needed version. Links below:
