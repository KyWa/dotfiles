# MongoDB

Compared to SQL here is the break down:

| NOSQL      | SQL      |
| ---        | ---      |
| Database   | Database |
| Collection | Table    |
| Document   | Row      |

Documents are stored like JSON files and are basically Key/Value based (at first glance).

```json
"fullname":{
    "first":"john",
    "last":"smith"
    },
"address":{
    "number":123,
    "street":"Smith",
    "city":"Scranton",
    "state":"PA",
    "zip":80001
    }
}
```
