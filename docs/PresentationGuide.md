### Guide to Headings and Titles

* Headings help us locate information
* Clear and specific headings make it easier to find information
* Useful and usable headings make it easier to find, categorize, and curate information
* Headings and titles should focus on what the reader wants to do

#### What Makes a Title or Heading Good?

*A good title or heading is:*

* Specific
* Relevant
* Informative
* Audience-focused

Be consistent, Be succinct, and avoid clutter. When writing a document think of what type of document it will be. Red Hat uses 3 information types: Procedure, Concept, Reference.

* Procedure - Describes actions. Should start with a verb
* Concept - Describes things. A few types of concepts: Definition, Principal, Classification
* Reference - Provides supplementary information. Usually a table or list

Procedure documents should be task oriented versus feature oriented. 

#### The Red Hat Way
Red Hat documentation falls into three categories: procedures, concepts, and references.

| Title Type | Use  | Example                            |
| ---        | ---  | ---                                |
| Procedure  | Verb | Install  Fedora                    |
| Concept    | Noun | Application Programming Interfaces |
| Reference  | Noun | Password Command: Use and Syntax   |
