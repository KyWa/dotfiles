# README

This repo is for my config files for my workstations as well as my Vimwiki documentation. Links don't work because they are linked locally and not via the remote repository paths (dir/file vs github.com/repo/file). This will most likely never be altered as my specific usecase is inside of Vim to read the documentation.
